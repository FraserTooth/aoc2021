Advent of Code 2021

Doing it with go, because I wanna.
They're all quite messy solutions, keep in mind I was trying to do the challenges in between caring for a newborn, I have good reason to feel lazy 😅

**UPDATE**: Yeah I gave up on Day 18, I think it was a combination of a sleepless night and a very faffy daily challenge 😆 still I learnt a bunch about Go so 👍
